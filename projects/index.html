This dataset can be used to build a machine learning model to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. In this process, diabetes prediction is performed on 1,000 data, which in this case refers to patients.</p>

This robot is used in the Indonesian Robot Contest (Kontes Robot Indonesia - KRI) 2023 in the Indonesian Thematic Robot Contest (Kontes Robot Tematik Indonesia - KRTMI) category. In this contest, there are changes to the rules from the previous year. One of them is an octagonal coin, with the placement of the coin having to cover the circle on the field. At the national level, matches against robot opponents are a battle of strategy and speed with different fields in the form of a green screen and combined on a monitor. Robot and coin detection uses a QR code that is installed and read as a robot or coin on the jury's computer. So to find out where to place the coins by looking at the monitor, there is also a penalty if the robot hit an opposing robot or exceed the maximum speed limit.</p>
